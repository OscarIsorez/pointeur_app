# Edit Session Dialog Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Date Selection Feature
- **Added date picker**: Users can now select any date (up to today) to edit work sessions
- **Interactive date field**: The date display is now clickable with visual cues (edit icon and helper text)
- **Maximum date constraint**: Users cannot select future dates

### 2. Smart Date Updates
- **Automatic time adjustment**: When changing the date, all times (arrival, departure, breaks) are automatically updated to use the new date while preserving hours and minutes
- **Break time synchronization**: All break periods are updated to match the selected date

### 3. Visual Improvements
- **Warning indicator**: Shows an orange warning box when editing past dates to remind users to verify the times
- **Better UI feedback**: Added edit icon and helper text to make it clear the date is editable
- **Enhanced styling**: Added border and better visual hierarchy

### 4. User Experience Benefits
- **Fix forgotten check-outs**: Users can now edit previous days when they forgot to check out
- **Prevent inflated work hours**: No more 24+ hour work sessions that mess up statistics
- **Flexible data correction**: Can adjust any past work session up to the current date

## Usage
1. **Open edit dialog**: Tap the edit button on any work session
2. **Change date**: Tap on the date field to select a different day
3. **Adjust times**: Set correct arrival/departure times and breaks
4. **Save changes**: The session will be updated with the correct date and times

## Technical Details
- Date picker uses `CupertinoDatePicker` in date mode
- All DateTime objects are properly synchronized when date changes
- Session copying includes the new date field
- Helper method `_isToday()` determines when to show warnings

This improvement addresses the common issue of users forgetting to check out and having to manually correct their work hours for accurate time tracking and statistics.
